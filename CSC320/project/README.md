## File Specification:
Files|Description
---|---
sud2sat.py|Basic Task, read sodoku and gnerate folders containing **miniSAT CNF-formatted inputs and outputs** respectively.
sat2sud.py|Basic Task, read the outputs generated from previous task and generate a folder containing the **solutions to the puzzles**
README.md|Contains the necessary information for the project and orientation to the files.
p096_sudoku.txt|provided by professor as sudoku puzzle exanmples to test your SAT-based sudoku solver.
top95.txt|provided by professor as hard inputs to test your solver in the extended tasks.
4x4grid.txt|a single 4x4 sudoku puzzle input to test the flexibility for puzzles of any length.
intructions|contains the project specifications
Grid_CNF4x4|folder **generated by sud2sat.py** to contain the CNF-formatted inputs for miniSAT if the **read file is 4x4grid.txt.**
Grid_CNF|folder **generated by sud2sat.py** to contain the CNF-formatted inputs for miniSAT if the **read file is p096_sudoku.txt.**
Grid_CNF_extended|folder **generated by sud2sat.py** to contain the CNF-formatted inputs for miniSAT if the **read file is top95.txt.**
miniSAT_encoded|folder **generated in sud2sat.py** contains the encoded files by miniSAT with input **argument "p096_sudoku.txt"**
miniSAT_encoded4x4|folder **generated in sud2sat.py** contains the encoded files by miniSAT with input **argument "4x4grid.txt"**
miniSAT_hard_encoded|folder **generated in sud2sat.py** contains the encoded files by miniSAT with input **argument "top95.txt"**
Sudoku_hard_solved|folder **generated in sat2sud.py** contains the solutions to sudoku puzzles **with argument "miniSAT_hard_encoded"**
Sudoku_solved|folder **generated in sat2sud.py** contains the solutions to sudoku puzzles **with argument "miniSAT_encoded"**
Sudoku_solved4x4|folder **generated in sat2sud.py** contains the solutions to sudoku puzzles **with argument "miniSAT_encoded4x4"**

## Executions
*Notice:* all the sudoku puzzles in this project must be in the format of either ***top95.txt*** (hard-input, '*' applied), ***4x4grid.txt*** (single puzzle, '0' applied), and ***p096_sudoku.txt*** (multiple puzzles, '0' applied)

file executed|Command|Argument|Output|Property
---|---|---|---|---
***sud2sat.py***|`python sud2sat.py [file name]` or `python3 sud2sat.py [file name]`|`[file name]` we have three files available: ***top95.txt***, ***4x4grid.txt*** (all for extended task), and ***p096_sudoku.txt*** (for basic task).|two folders, one (***Grid_CNF4x4/Grid_CNF/Grid_CNF_extended***) that contains miniSAT CNF-format inputs; another (***miniSAT_encoded4x4/miniSAT_encoded/miniSAT_hard_encoded***) that contains the miniSAT endcoded files, respectively and accordingly to the argument|basic and extended tasks mixed; available to process sudoku puzzles of any length.
***sat2sud.py***|`python sat2sud.py [folder name]` or `python3 sat2sud.py [folder name]`|`[folder name]` we have three files available: ***miniSAT_hard_encoded***, ***miniSAT_encoded4x4*** (all for extended task), and ***miniSAT_encoded*** (for basic task).|a folder(***Sudoku_hard_solved/Sudoku_solved/Sudoku_solved4x4***) that contains solutions accordingly to the argument|basic and extended tasks mixed; available to process sudoku puzzles of any length.

## Basic Tasks
The way of executing buth `sud2sat.py` and `sat2sud.py` has been mentioned in last section. So are their input arguments and outputs;

## Extended task #1: Alternative to minimal encoding using `top95.txt`
There is no additional programs to the extended tasks, you still have to use `sud2sat.py` with arguemnt `top95.txt` are the program will produce the right outputs. And similarly you use `sat2sud.py` with name of the folder produced last step and containing the encoded outputs of miniSAT, then you get solutions of sudoku puzzles

## Extended task #2: 

## Extended task #3: nxn-sized puzzles
No additional programs, the original `sud2sat.py` and `sat2sud.py` are designed to handle sudoku puzzles of any length with the premise that the formatting of input puzzles is similar as ones of puzzles given by the professor.

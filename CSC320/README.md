# Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes
***2018-Summer | Professor: Bruce Kapron***<br/>

Our goal is to understand when it is possible to solve a problem computationally, and how limitations on computational resources limit the class of problems that can be solved. We will develop tools for solving problems in various computational models, and for proving that a solution is not possible. We will characterize the class of problems solvable in a model and understand what it means for models to be equivalent. We will examine the importance of reductions between problems from a theoretical and practical perspective.

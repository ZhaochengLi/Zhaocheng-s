#(1) file handling
#
#    step 1: download data file &quot;data-ex-2-1 (Rocket Prop)&quot; which is an MS Excel file.
#    step 2: open the file in Excel. Then save it (a) in type &quot;Formatted text (space delimited)&quot; 
#            and (b) under a new nameas &quot;data-ex-2-1&quot;. The file will be automatically identified 
#            by a .prn indicating its type is Formatted text.
#    step 3: open data-ex-2-1 in MS Word and edit the name of the variables to
# 
#    Obs       y      x
#    1      2158.70 15.50
#    2      1678.15 23.75
#    3      2316.00  8.00
#    ......


#(2) Read data file into R

data1=read.table(file=&quot;data-ex-2-1.prn&quot;, header=TRUE)  # file must be in R working directory (use
#                R comment getwd() to find out) or a complete path to the file must be specified.
attach(data1)  # data1 is a table in R. This allows variables in the table to be used individually.
print(data1)   # see if there data points are correct



#(2) Data analysis

plot(x,y,xlab=&quot;age&quot;,ylab=&quot;shear strength&quot;) # generates a scatter plot to see what model to use
fit1=lm(y~x,data1)   # fit a linear model; results of the fit saved in &quot;variable&quot; fit1

anova(fit1)   # view ANOVA part of the results
summary(fit1) # see other results (t-tests, F-tests, R-squared) 

newx=data.frame(x=c(5,10))   # specify x values at which predictions about y are to be made
predict(fit1, newx, interval=&quot;confidence&quot;)   # predictions for the E(y|x) at x=5 and x=10
predict(fit1, newx, interval=&quot;prediction&quot;)   # predictions for y|x=5 and y|x=10

abline(fit1,col=&quot;red&quot;)  # add the ls line to the scatter plot
title(&quot;Least squares regression line&quot;)

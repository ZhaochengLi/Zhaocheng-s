in the development of the theory of computing, we have presented several models of coputing devices:

1. Finite automata are good models for devices that have a small amount of memory;

2. Pushdown automata are models for devices that have an unlimited memory that is useable ONLY in the last in, first out manner of a stack.

However, we have shown that some very simple tasks are beyond the capabilities of these models. Hence they are too restricted to serve as models of general purpose computers.



CHAPTER THREE: TURING MACHINES

A much more powerful model, firstly propised by Alan Turing in 1936, called the 'Turing Machine'.

It is similar to a finite automata but with an unlimited and unrestricted memory.

A Turing Machine is a much more accurate model of a general purpose computer. A TM can do everything that a real computer can do.(Nonetheless, even a TM cannot solve certain problems. In a very real sense, these problems are beyond the theoretical limits of computations).

--CHARACTERS:
	1. It uses an infinite tape as its unlimited memory.	
	2. It has a tape head that can READ AND WRITE symbols and move around on the tape.
	3. Initially the tape contains only the input string and is blank everywhere else; if the machine needs to store information, it may write this information on the tape.
	4. To read the information that it has written, the machine can move its head back over it.
	5. The machine continues computing until it decides to produce an output. The OUTPUT (ACCEPT and REJECT) are obtained by entering designated accepting and rejecting states
	6. If it does not enter an accepting or a rejecting state, it will go on forever, NEVER HALTING.

--DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FAs AND TMs:
	1. the TM can both write on the tape and read from it.
	2. the read-write head can move both to the left and to the right.
	3. the tape is infinite.
	4. the special states for rejecting and accepting take effect immediately.

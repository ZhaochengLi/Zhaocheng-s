# CSC361: Computer Communication and Networks
#### Fall-2018-UVic | Professor: Mantis Cheng

### Overview:
> This course is an introduction to data communication networks and the architecture of TCP/IP protocol stack, which empowers the internet that connects "everything" and "everything". The topics covered are all about the TCP/IP protocal stack, including the Application, Transport, Network and Link layers.

### Topics:
***Introduction***

- Internet overview
- Network technologies and structures
- Packet and Circuit Switching
- Network architectures, services and protocols

***Application layer***

- Client-server model
- World-Wide Web (WWW)
- Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- Domain Name System (DNS)
- Email (POP3/SMTP)
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Socket Application Programming Interface

***Transport layer***

- Transport layer services
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- TCP connection management techniques
- TCP flow, error and congestion control

***Network layer***

- Network layer services
- Internet Protocol (IP)
- IP Addressing and Forwarding Tables
- Routers and Switches
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
- Autonomous Systems
- Basic routing algorithms: distance vector and link state
- Internet routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP)

***Link layer***

- Link layer services
- Link layer error and flow control techniques
- Medium Access Control (MAC) techniques
- Link layer interworking techniques

### Course Objectives And Learning Outcomes
To understand the principles and practice of designing, building, and operating computer networks, particularly the Internet, and the TCP/IP protocol stack, with hands-on programming labs using Python.

From the lectures and online videos, you will learn:

- how the Internet was designed,
- how the TCP/IP stack works,
- how Internet applications are implemented,
- how data are transported over an unreliable network such as the Internet,
- the design principles behind the TCP/IP protocols, and
- how routers/switches operate.

From the programming labs and exercises, you will learn:

- how to use socket programming API to build Internet applications,
- how to analyze network traffic using a packet sniffer such as Wireshark,
- how TCP initiates and take down connections, and sends/receives data,
- the principles of multiplexing/demultiplexing and encapsulation,
- how to evaluate the performance of packet switching networks.

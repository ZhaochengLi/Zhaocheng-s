## Q1

  1. How long does it take a packet of length $L$=1000 bytes to propagate over a link of distance $d$=2500 km, where propagation speed is $s=2.5 \times 10^8$ m/s, and  transmission rate of $R$=2 Mbps?  

    - 2500 * 1000 / (2.5 * 10^8ï¼‰= 0.01s


  2. More generally, how long does it take a packet of length $L$ to propagate over a link of distance $d$ with propagation speed $s$, and transmission rate $R$ bps?

    - d / s


  3. Does this delay depend on **packet length**?

    - No


  4. Does this delay depend on **transmission rate**?

    - No


## Q2
Suppose two hosts __A__ and __B__, are separated by $d$=20,000 km and are connected by a link $R$=1Gbps ($10^9$ bps). Assume that the propagation speed $s=2.5 \times 10^8$ m/s,

  1. Calculate the **bandwidth-delay** product, i.e., $R \times$ propagation delay. What is the **unit**?

    - 20,000,000 / (2.5*10^8) * 10^9 = 80,000,000 bits


  2. Consider sending a file of $L$=800,000 bits from __A__ to __B__. If the file is sent continuously as one large message, what is the **maximum** number of bits that will be in the link at any given time?

    - 800,000 bits



  3. What is the **width (in meters) of a bit** in the link? (If $N$ is the number of bits in the wire with a distance of $K$ meters, then $K/N$ is meters per bit.)

    - 0.25


  4. Derive a general expression for the **width of a bit** in terms of the propagation speed $s$, the transmission rate $R$ and the length of the link $d$.

    - d / (R * (d / s))

## Q3
In modern packet-switched networks, the source host segments long, application-layer messages (for example, an image or a music file) into smaller packets and sends the packets into the network. The receiver then reassembles the packets back into the original message. We refer to this process as __message segmentation__.


![](q3.jpg)


Assume we have a source __A__ and a destination __B__, connected via three links and two switches __S1__ and __S2__. __A__ connects to __S1__, __S1__ to __S2__, and __S2__ to __B__.


We will consider two case where a message is sent from __A__ to __B__ with and without __message segmentation__. Consider a message that is $L=7.5 \times 10^6$ bits long that is to be sent from __A__ to __B__ in the following manner. And suppose each link $R=1.5 \times 10^6$ bps. For the time being, ignore propagation, queuing, and processing delays.


  1. Consider sending the message from __A__ to __B__ without __message segmentation__. How long does it take to move the message from the host __A__ to the first packet switch __S1__? Keeping in mind that each switch uses store-and-forward packet switching, what is the total time to move the message from __A__ to __B__ ?

    - 7.5 / 1.5 = 5s
    - 5 * 3 = 15s


  2. Now suppose that the message is __segmented__ into 5,000 packets, with each packet being 1,500 bits long. How long does it take to move the first packet from __A__ to the first switch __S1__?

    - 1500 / (1.5 * 10^6) = 0.001s


  3. When the first packet is being sent from the first switch __S1__ to the second switch __S2__, the second packet is being sent from the __A__ to the first switch __S1__. At what time will the second packet be fully received at the first switch __S1__?

    - 0.002s


  4. How long does it take to move the file from __A__ to __B__ when __message segmentation__ is used?

    - 0.001 * 3 + 4999 * 0.001 = 5.002s

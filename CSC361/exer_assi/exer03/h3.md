# Homework 3 (Python Sockets)

This exercise is designed for you to practice Python socket programming. When you are done, attach four files in your submission box in Connex. Follow the instructions posted in the links below.

## Concepts
  - What is a **socket**?
  - How to use UDP sockets
  - How to use TCP sockets
  - Client/Server applications
  - UDP vs TCP communication
  - Berkeley Sockets API 


## Q1
Write a `udpclient.py` and `udpserver.py`, then test them with server starts first, and then try again with client starts first. (__Note__:Use this reference as your starting: [Programming UDP sockets in python](https://www.binarytides.com/programming-udp-sockets-in-python/).



## Q2
Now write a `tcpclient.py` and `tcpserver.py`, then test them with server starts first, and then try again with client starts first. (__Note__:Use this reference as your starting: [Programming TCP sockets in python](https://www.binarytides.com/python-socket-programming-tutorial/).

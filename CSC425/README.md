# CSC425: Analysis of Algorithms
#### Fall-2018-UVic | Professor: Valerie King

### About this course:
In order to handle big data, we are learning some recent developments in the design and analysis of algorithms.

We are going to deal with big data problems when there is inefficient time and space for the usual techniques. 

Instead, we are showing:
- how to solve **max flow** and **cut** problems in linear or near linear time approximations;
- how to deal with streaming input and create data structures for input which is changing over time, when updates are needed to be done quickly when there is inefficient space to store the entire input;
- consider the parallelism and methods for proving lower bounds;
---
Techniques will draw on including:
- basic graph algoeithms;
- proof skills;
- data structures;
- elementary probability and
- linear algebra

### For anyone who is interested in the topics covered specifically,
- Approximation methods
- Network flow
- Randomized algorithms
- Streaming algorithms
- Machine learning
- Advanced data structures and dynamic graphs

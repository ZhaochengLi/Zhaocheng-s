    "    - if a variable is defined outside of a function, it will be globally scoped and available to all scripts.

    "JavaScript can access objects in the page and the browser window, but did you know it’s also “listening” for certain events to happen? \n",

    "**An event is an action that can be detected with JavaScript, such as when the document loads or when the user clicks on an element or just moves her mouse over it**. \n",
    "\n",
    "HTML 4.0 made it possible for a script to be tied to events on the page **whether initiated by the user, the browser itself, or other scripts. This is known as event binding.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In scripts, an event is identified by **an event handler**. For example, *the onload event handler triggers a script when the document loads, and the onclick and onmouseover handlers trigger a script when the user clicks or mouses over an element, respectively*. Here are some of the most common event handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Event Handler | Event description\n",
    "---|---\n",
    "onblur | An element loses focus\n",
    "onchange | The content of a form field changes\n",

    "onfocus | An element gets focus\n",

    "There are three common methods for applying event handlers to items within our pages:\n",
    "- As an HTML attribute\n",
    "- As a method attached to the element\n",
    "- Using **addEventListener**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the latter two approaches, we will use the **window** object. **Any events we attach to window apply to the entire document. We will be using the onclick event in all the these as well.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**As an HTML attribute**, you can specify the function to be run in an attribute in the markup as shown,\n",
    "\n",
    "    <body onclick=\"myFunction();\"> /* myFunction will now run when the user clicks anything within \"body\" */\n",
    "    \n",
    "but it should be avoided for the same reason we avoid using **style** attributes in our markup to apply styles to individual elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a method**, it keeps things strictly whthin our scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    window.onclick = myFunction; /* myFunction will run when the user clicks anything within the browser window */\n",
    "    \n",
    "we can also use an anonymous function rather than a predefined one:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    window.onclick = function(){\n",
    "        /* any code placed here will run when the user clicks anything within the browser window */\n",
    "    };\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has the benefit of both simplicity and ease of maintenance, but does have **a fairly major drawback: we can bind only one event at a time with this method.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    window.onclick = myFunction\n",
    "    window.onclick = myOtherFunction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the second binding overwrites the first, so when user clicks inside the browser window, only myOtherFunction will run. The reference to **myFunction** is thrown away.\n",
    "\n",
    "**addEventListener**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to keep our logic within our scripts and allows us to perform multiple bindings on a single object.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by calling the **addEventListener** method of the target object, and then specify the event in question and the function to be executed as two arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    window.addEventListener(\"click\", myFunction);\n",
    "    // notice we omit the preceding \"on\" from the event handler with this syntax.\n",
    "    \n",

    "### Chapter 2: Using JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's introduce some of the ways we can put it to use in modern web design. We will explore DOM scripting, which allows us to manipulate the elements, attributes and text on a page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Section: Document Object Model (DOM)\n",
    "It gives us a way to access and manipulate the contents of a document. The DOM is a programming interface (an API) for HTML and XML pages. It provides a strctured map of the document, as well as a set of methods to interface with the elements contained therein.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively, **it translates our markup into a format that JS(and other languages) can understand. Basically, it serves as a mapto all the elements on a page**. We can use it to find elements by their names or attributes, then add, modify, or delete elements and their content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the DOM, JS wouldn't have any sense of a document's contents. Everything from the page's **doctype** to each individual letter in the text can be accessed via the DOM and manipulated with JS.\n",

    "#### Section: the Node Tree\n",
    "See the simple document tree\n",
    "\n",
    "    <html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",

    "        </div>\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "    </html>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Each element within the page is referred to as a node**. If you think of the DOM as a tree, each node is individual branch that can contain further branches. But the DOM allows deeper access to the content than CSS **because it treats that actual content as a node as well**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the **p** element, the element, its attributes, and its contents are all nodes in the DOM's node tree.\n",

    "          \n",
    "- By class attribute value, **getElementByClassName()**\n",
    "    - this allows you to access nodes in the document based on the value of a **class** attribute. This statement assigns any element with a **class** value of \"column-a\" to the variable **firstColum** so it can be accessed easily from within a script.\n",

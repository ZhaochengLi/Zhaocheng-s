    "1. External Style Sheets\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Embedded Style Sheets\n",
    "    - It is placed in a document using the *style* element, and its rules apply only to that document. The *style* element must be placed in the *head* of the document.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        \n",
    "            <head>\n",
    "                <title>Required document title here</title> \n",

    "                </style>\n",
    "            </head>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inline Styles\n",
    "    - You can apply properties and values to a single element using the *style* attribute in the element itself:\n",
    "    \n",
    "            <h1 style=\"color: red\">Intriduction</h1>\n",

    "    - Inline styles apply only to the particular element in which they appear. Inline styles should be avoided, unless it is absolutely necessary to over-ride styles from an embedded or external style sheet.\n",
    "    - They are actually **problematic** in that they interperse presentation information into the structural markup. And they also make it more difficult to make changes because **every **style** attribute must be hunted dowm in the source**."

    "**Font Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Browsers are limited to displaying fonts they have access to. Traditionally, that meant the fonts that were already installed on the user’s hard drive. In 2010, **however, there was a boom in browser support for embedded web fonts using the CSS @font-face rule, so it became possible for designers to provide their own fonts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But back to our font-family rule. Even when you specify that the font should be Futura in a style rule, if the browser can’t find it (for example, if font is not installed on the user’s computer or the provided web font fails to load), the browser uses its default font instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, CSS allows us to provide a list of back-up fonts (that font stack we saw earlier) should our first choice not be available. If the first specified font is not found, the browser tries the next one, and down through the list until it finds one that works. In the third font-family rule shown in the previous code example, if the browser does not find Duru Sans, it will use Verdana, and if Verdana is not available, it will substitute some other sans-serif font.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generic Font Families**\n",
    "\n",
    "**sans-serif** is just one of the five generic font families that you can specify with the font-family property. When you specify a generic font family, the browser chooses an available font from that stylistic category. Generic font family names do not need to be capitalized. (e.g., serif, sans-serif, monospace, ...)\n",

    "- start with your first choice \n",
    "- provide some similar alternatives\n",
    "- then end with a generic font family that at least gets users in the right stylistic ballpark. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want an upright, sans-serif font, you might start with your favorite font (Futura), list a few that are more common (Univers, Tahoma, Geneva), and finish with the generic sans-serif. There is no limit to the number of fonts you can include, but many designers strive to keep it under 10\n",

Assignment Two File Description

This compressed file consists of a folder with 5 files, which are the following:
	1. A2Code_1_Li_Zhaocheng.R // the R source code of my assignment
	2. A2Report_1_Li_Zhaocheng.pdf // the report
	3. HIV.comp.rda // comlete dataset
	4. Matrix.png // The 8-by-20 miss classification rate table, it is the result.
	5. Rplot.png // the system of boxplots onr for each model, used to compare and analysis.

In oeder to assess the R program, the TA should change the working directory at the top of code.
	- and the working directory should be modified in the form "~/..../A2_1_Li_Zhaocheng"

And I also apply 
	- Helperfunction.R and 
	- partial exampleStacking.R 
from the instructor Zhang in my program.

Notice: 
	The runtime takes just so long, and I tried my best to upload everything necessary for grader, and I hope you can assess my work without running too much of code.
	
	In my code, I leave the glmnet for the last to process. This means nothing but save time, and it seems not working...

Assignment One File Description

This compressed file consists of a folder with 5 files, which are the following:
	1. A1Code_1_Li_Zhaocheng.R // the R source code of my assignment
	2. A1Report_1_Li_Zhaocheng.pdf // the report
	3. HIV.complete.rda // comlete dataset
	4. HIV.expert.rda // expert dataset
	5. Assignment 1.xlsx // Excel file containg statistics

In oeder to assess the R program, the TA should change the working directory at the top of code.
	- and the working directory should be modified in the form "~/..../A1_1_Li_Zhaocheng"

I use packages 
	- 'caret' and 'glmnet' in my program. 

And I also apply 
	- Helperfunction.R and 
	- partial exampleStacking.R 
from the instructor Zhang in my program.

Notice: 
	After the consideration, I decide to leave all my code available for execution especially inside the main skeleton (10-fold CV loop). It means TA will not change anything to get the full dataset I need, and all codes are proven working properly.
	
	BUT, it means the loop will take a really amount of time to process. So please BE PATIENT, it works as long as there is NO ERROR, right?
	
	And all the data needed should be available already.
	
	Below and outside the 10-fold CV loop, I will left all code available for execution, no matter for no-stacking, stacking, or improved stacking process. So you should execute not necessarily all of them, but selectively based on your need each time.

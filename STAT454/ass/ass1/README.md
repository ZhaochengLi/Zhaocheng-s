### Zhaocheng Li | Intructor: Xuekui Zhang | Fall-2018 | UVic

#### Background:
- HIV as a wirldwide disease has affected about 2 million people per year, and we usually use anti-troviral drugs to treat HIV-1 affection.
- The performance of the treatment is influenced by the ***drug resistance*** which is usually **caused by mutation** in molecular targets.
#### Our purpose:
> *Unravel the relationship between mutations and HIV-1 drug resistance is very helpful to design new drugs and optimize existing drugs*
#### Approach:
In order to achieve this, we aim to:
- Identify the HIV-1 drug resistance mutations, and
- Use it to **predict changes in drug susceptibility in future patients.**

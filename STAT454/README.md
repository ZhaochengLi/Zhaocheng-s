# STAT454: Topics in Applied Statistics: Machine Learning
#### Fall-2018-UVic | Professor/Intructor: Xuekui Zhang

### Overview:
> Machine Learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn"(e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific task) ***with data***, without being explicitly programmed.

> Learning denotes changes in the system that are adaptive in the sense that they enable the system to do the task or tasks drawn from the same population more efficiently and more effectively the next time.

Machien Learning is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of Statistics, CS and EE etc.

Today, in this course, the instructor believes that the Machine Learning has evolved and become ***Applied Statistics with a CS flavor.***

Have you ever imaged: Is it possible to just have one best algorithm for all?

- A lovely theorem call "No Free Lunch Theorem", by Wolpert, D.H., Macready, W.G. (1997) states that:

> If an algorithm performs well on a certain class of problems than it necessarily pays for that with degraded performance on the set of all remaining programs

let's find out together throughout this course!!

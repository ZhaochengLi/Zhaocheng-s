    "### Recall: Python Classes and objects\n",
    "- A *class* is a special data type which defines how to build a certain kind of object.\n",
    "- Almost everything in python is an object, with its properties and methods. A class is like an object constructor, or a \"blueprint\" for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class className():\n",
    "#statements\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Key word *class* is used to define a class,\n",
    "- A class definition creates a class object from which class instances may be created.\n",
    "- Class attributes are just like variables\n",
    "- Class methods are functions invoked on an instance of the class\n",
    "- Instances are objects created that use the class definition. Just call the class definition like a function to create a class instance\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "calc = Calculator()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__` method is like an initialization constructor. When a class defines an `__init__()` method, class definition *automatically* invokes `__init__()` method for the newly created class instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Calculator():\n",
    "\tcounter = 0\n",
    "\tdef __init__(self, x=0, y=0):\n",
    "\t\tself.x=x\n",
    "\t\tself.y=y\n",
    "\tdef add(self):\n",
    "\t\treturn self.x+self.y\n",
    "calc=Calculator(10,20)\n",
    "print(calc.x) #10\n",
    "print(calc.y) #20\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `self` keyword:\n",
    "\t- The first argument of **every method** is a reference to the current instance of the class\n",
    "\t- By convention, we name this argument `self`\n",
    "\t- In `__init__`, `self` refers to the object currently being created.\n",
    "\t- In other class methods, it refers to the instance whose method was called.\n",
    "\t- Similar to the keyword `this` in Java or C++.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Accessing the attributes and methods: the dot in `calc.x` is used to access class attributes and methods\n",
    "- Although you must specify `self` explicitly when defining the method, you do not include it when calling the method: `calc.add()`. Pyhton passes it for you automatically.\n",
    "- Deleting instances: when you are done with an object, you do not have to delete or free it explicitly. Python has a **automatic garbage collection** to detect and delete whne all references to a piece of memory have gone out of scope. It frees the memory with fewer memory leaking.\n",
    "- Data attributes (such as `self.x` and `self.y`) are variables **owned by a particular instance**. Each instance has its own value for data attributes. In python, you do not have a restriction of declaring all data attributes before hand, you can cerate data attributes at runtime anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "calc1 = Calculator(10,20)\n",
    "calc2 = Calculator(30,40)\n",
    "calc1.z = calc1.x + calc1.y\n",
    "print(calc.z) #30 here calc.z is an attribute defined at runtime outside the class definition.\n",
    "print(calc1.x, calc1.y, calc2.x, calc2.y) #10, 20, 30, 40\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class Attributes are defined **within a class definition and outside of any method**. Because all instances of a class share one copy of a class attribute, when any instance changes it, the value is changed for all instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Calculator():\n",
    "\tcounter = 0 # the class attribute\n",
    "\tdef __init__(self, x=0, y=0):\n",
    "\t\tself.x=x # the data attribute\n",
    "\t\tself.y=y # the data attribute\n",
    "\tdef add(self):\n",
    "\t\tself.__class__.counter +=1\n",

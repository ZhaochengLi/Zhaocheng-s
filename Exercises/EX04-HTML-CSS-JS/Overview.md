### This is a introductory course to the functionalities of JS, HTML, and CSS to the web design.
> It is easy to forget that code without a browser is just a text file -- it's when you put that text file into a browser that the magic happens.
> When you open a web page, your browser fetches the HTML and other programming languages involved and interprets it.

#### An overview:
- HTML: it provides the **basic structure** of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.
- CSS: it is used to control **presentation, formatting, and layout**
- JavaScript: it is used to control the **behaviors of different elements**

#### Let figure out more about their roles
##### HTML: always at the core position regardless complexity of a site and other languages involved.
- It is both essential and fundamental.
- HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language". The "Markup Language" means that, rather than being a programming language that uses a programming language to perform functions, it uses tags to identify content.
- Just like for an article having **title**, **header**, and so on. The "Markup language" work in the same way, by labeling those content types, using code. Especially, we achieve this with **HTML tags**, also called **"elements"**. These tags are really straightforward: **Header tags**, **paragraph tags**, **image tags**, and so on.
- Each type of content on the page is "wrapped" in by HTML tags.
- Notations, **opening paragraph**, `<p>` snd the **closing paragraph**, `</p>`
- Usages, using HTML, for example, you are able to add headings, format paragraphs, control line breaks, make lists, emphasize text, create special characters, insert images, create links, build tables, control some styling, and much more.

##### CSSï¼šit gives your entire website its style, i.e., colors, fonts, background images, ...
- It affects the entire mood and tone of a web page.
- **It is also what allows websites to adapt to different screen sizes and device types.**
- CSS, stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" where "Style Sheet" means documents itself.
  > Every web browser has a default style sheet, so every web page out there is affected by at least one style sheet -- the default style sheet of whatever browser the web page visitor is using -- regardless whether or not the web designer applies any styles. For example, my browser's default font style is Times New Roman, size 12, so if I visited a web page where the designer didn't apply a style sheet of their own, I would see the web page in Times New Roman, size 12.
- Put simply, CSS is a list of rules that can assign different properties to HTML tags, either specified to single tags, multiple tags, an entire document, or multiple documents.

##### JS: it is a programming language that lets web developers design **interactive sites**. Most dynamic behavior you'll see on a web page is thanks you JavaScript, which **augments a browser's default controls and bahaviors**.
- for example, the "boxes" that pop up on your screen.
- After filling you infomation session on line and a comfirmation box poped up, letting you to press Yes/No.
- `slide-in call-to-action`
- Security password creation, check forms, interactive games, special effects, build mobile apps and create server-based applications.
